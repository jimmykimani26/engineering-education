### Introduction

Technology is growing at a fast pace in recent years. Due to this, it is now easy to get lost in the rumpus of technological terms that keep popping up every day. Machine learning and deep learning are among the fast-growing technologies. Besides this two, [Internet of Things (IoT](https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/Internet-of-Things-IoT)), [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), and [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence-ai.asp) (AI) are among the fast-growing technologies.

New ideas in the tech world have led to various innovations that have sparked the nature of things. Machine learning and deep learning have attracted great attention over the years. The popularity of these two has led to various applications implementing its tools.

This article will focus on understanding what machine learning and deep learning are. Both applications, differences, and functionality will be emphasized in this article.

### Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning is a technological tool that uses algorithmic interpretations. This has helped in obtaining and using data to make and interpret final decisions. Machine learning processes are also dependent on the subsets of artificial intelligence. Several [synthetic intelligence](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Synthetic_intelligence) aspects and modern [virtual assistants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/virtual-assistant.asp) are created to achieve this.

Machine learning uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques that assist in decision making. Conventional algorithms in AI aid in performing mathematical computation and predictions. Machine learning depends on fed structured data. Conventional algorithms aids in achieving data mining and predictive analytics in a search.

Unlike machine learning, AI can use [unstructured data](https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data.html) and still be able to function. Deep learning does mimic the human brain's workings. This is because it uses this data to perform the processing of data. Machine learning aids in the detection of objects, language translation, and decision making. Machine learning is also able to recognize speech and make prompt decisions. The AI makes this possible this allows in no aspect of human supervision.

### Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Deep learning uses networks that operate unsupervised and one that uses [structured data](https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data.html). This is like the human brain structure as it operates as a subset of machine learning.

This is to means that the algorithms used are complex and are from neural networks. This resemblance is like the layers with neural connections in the human brain.

### How deep learning works

Deep learning uses algorithms whose functionality is like that of machine learning. One major distinction on each layer is that it has a different interpretation of data. The [neural networks](https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414) learn where data is fetched.

The neurons in the network undertake two tasks. The first includes understanding which feature is optimal for performing a specific task. The second one involves classifying data after many iterations of the learning process. In case there is a mistake, the deep learning model's accuracy increases. Deep learning is, thus, a more complex and more capable version of machine learning.

### Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

Deep learning differs from machine learning in some aspects. One major attribute is that deep learning learns from its mistakes. In most cases, this is achieved without human intervention. As for machine learning, there is a need for a human to correct the mistake made.

Deep learning then adopts an algorithm then learns not to make that mistake again in the future. This enhances the [multi-level neural networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-layer-neural-networks-with-sigmoid-function-deep-learning-for-rookies-2-bf464f09eb7f?gi=e7b1f9430ac5) to learn from their mistakes. But, this model does not guarantee success or no mistakes in the future. This because a wrong prediction can be made depending on the quality of the data fed to them. The accuracy is dependent on the quality of data used to learn.

### Applications and Conclusion

Deep learning is currently being used in various industries and companies. Most of these companies involve the use of the high tech industry in their operations. Besides this, we, as consumers, are currently using these technologies and applications. People have been using and interact with these innovations without even realizing it.

Google applications like Gmail, Google Search, and Google Maps rely on deep learning. This is because such applications need accurate data to improve their intuitiveness. For instance, Gmail can detect important mails for the user. This is determined by the frequency through which a user gets to communicate. This is made effective by using a smart reply that offers a fast response to any email received. This feature depends on the content of the email received.

Besides this, Google Search uses a prediction that anticipates what one is doing. This includes a prediction through past searches, activities, and places visited. The Google Maps application keeps data that can trace the history of past locations. Due to this, the application makes correct and accurate predictions.

Machine learning stimulates the smooth transition of smart applications today. Most of these applications fetch a customized user experience that improves predictability. As a result, the user can enjoy the fast use of services offered by these applications.

Deep learning has increased efficiency thus eliminating the need for human supervision. This has led to increased performance by machines towards performing tasks. This is because deep learning allows the use of an algorithm that automates errors. This automation corrects any mistakes without involving human intervention to correct the error.

Both deep learning and machine learning have promoted efficiency in most applications. As a result, the acceleration and pace of technology has increased.
