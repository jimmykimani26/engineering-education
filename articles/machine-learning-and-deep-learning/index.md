### Introduction

Technology is growing at a fast pace in recent years. Due to this, it is now easy to get lost in the rumpus of technological terms that keep popping up every day. 

Machine learning and deep learning are among the fast-growing applications. Artificial Intelligence ([AI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence-ai.asp)) is one of the fast-growing technologies that has contributed significantly to the growth of machine and deep learning. 

The AI incorporates and avails intelligence that is used to enhance decision making on both applications. These applications have contributed significantly to solving problems that previously affected performances in some applications.  

New ideas in the tech world have led to various innovations that have sparked the nature of things. Alexa and Siri are [virtual assistant](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/virtual-assistant.asp) that enhance the use of machine learning and are widely used. 

Machine learning and deep learning have attracted significant attention over the years. The popularity of these two has led to various applications implementing its tools.

This article will focus on understanding what machine learning and deep learning are. The reader will have a deeper understanding of how these applications differ and enhance their functionalities.

### Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of AI that allows computer algorithms to make accurate data outcomes through interpretations. 

Machine learning is used to obtain and use data that is used to make final decisions. Machine learning processes are also dependent on the subsets of artificial intelligence. 

Machine learning allows the use the AI towards automating several functionalities used by machine learning. Besides this, the AI enhances neuroscience that emulates human intelligence, an aspect that machine learning lacks. Several [synthetic intelligence](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Synthetic_intelligence) aspects and modern [virtual assistants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/virtual-assistant.asp) are created to achieve this.

Machine learning uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques that assist in decision making. These techniques include the use of [conventional algorithms](http://wiki.cas.mcmaster.ca/index.php/Conventional_Encryption_Algorithms) used in performing mathematical computation and predictions.

 Machine learning uses both structured and unstructured data. The use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and decision-trees are examples that use unstructured data to make interpretations. 

 Structured data is presented in the form of columns and rows. Examples of structured data include strings, dates and numbers.

  Unstructured data information is stored as files. Examples include; images, word documents, email files, videos and audio files.

Conventional algorithms aids in achieving data mining and predictive analytics in a search. A conventional algorithm is an algorithm that aid in identifying, deciphering and enciphering keys that are identical, and need to be kept secret. A conventional algorithm maintains secrets in acryptographic environment.

Unlike machine learning, AI can use [unstructured data](https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data.html) and still be able to function. Deep learning emulates human intelligence workings. 
Machine learning aids in the detection of objects, language translation, and decision making. Machine learning is also able to recognize speech and make prompt decisions.
 AI enables technologies such as speech recognition without any human intervention. 

### Deep Learning

Deep learning is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of machine learning. Deep learning uses deep [neural networks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neuralnetwork.asp#:~:text=A%20neural%20network%20is%20a,organic%20or%20artificial%20in%20nature.) that are built using neural networks. Neural networks can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. 

Deep learning uses complex algorithms from neural networks. This resemblance is like the layers with neural connections in the human brain. 
The use of structured and unstructured data make deep learning work perfectly as when compared to machine learning.

### How deep learning works

Deep learning uses algorithms whose functionality is like that of machine learning. [Neural networks](https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414) extract and learn the features during training process.


The neurons in the network undertake two tasks. The first includes understanding which feature is optimal for performing a specific task. The second one involves classifying data after many iterations of the learning process.

 In case there is a mistake, the deep learning model's accuracy increases. This occurs when the model is specifically trained to identify and learn from the error. 
 Deep learning is, thus, a more complex and more capable version of machine learning. Besides this, deep learning has more number of parameters when compared to machine learning algorithms. 

### Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

Deep learning differs from machine learning in some aspects. Manual feature extraction is required for machine learning algorithms. 

However, deep learning does not require manual features for manually selecting features from the dataset.

Deep learning adopts an algorithm that learns not to repeat a mistake in the future.  [Multi-level neural networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-layer-neural-networks-with-sigmoid-function-deep-learning-for-rookies-2-bf464f09eb7f?gi=e7b1f9430ac5) are used to prevent the error from repetition.

 This model does not guarantee success since a wrong prediction can be made depending on the quality of the data fed to them. The accuracy is dependent on the quality of data used to learn.

### Applications

Deep learning is currently being used in various industries and companies. Most of these companies involve the use of the high tech industry in their operations. 

Besides this, we, as consumers, are currently using these technologies and applications. People have been using and interact with these innovations without even realizing it.

Google applications like Gmail, Google Search, and Google Maps rely on deep learning. These applications need accurate data to improve their intuitiveness.

 For instance, Gmail can detect important mails for the user. Special emails are detected by the frequency through which a user gets to communicate. An effective response is enhanced through the use of a smart reply that offers a fast response to any email received. This feature depends on the content of the email received.

Besides this, Google Search uses a prediction that anticipates what one is doing. Such predictions fetch past searches, activities, and places visited. The Google Maps application keeps data that can trace the history of past locations. Collected data allows the application to make correct and accurate predictions.

Machine learning stimulates the smooth transition of smart applications today. Most of these applications fetch a customized user experience that improves predictability. As a result, the user can enjoy the fast use of services offered by these applications.

Deep learning has increased efficiency, thus eliminating the need for human supervision. As a result, the performance of machines towards performing tasks has improved. 

Deep learning allows the use of an algorithm that automates errors. This automation corrects any mistakes without involving human intervention in places where human intervention is required.

 Services automated by AI has less probability of error, thus eliminating the need for human supervision.

### Conclusion
Both deep learning and machine learning have promoted efficiency in most applications. As a result, the acceleration of the field of AI has increased. This has led to an economic advantage to companies since efficiency in terms of time and money have been enhanced.
